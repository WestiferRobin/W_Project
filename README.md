# W Language

## What is W Lang and why was it created

  Back when I was in college I took a compiler course. The course was writing a compiler for C which generated sudo assembly using some tools like GNU Bision. I was inspired by this course and wanted to create my own programing language with a compiler without the use of a framework. I should of done this project in C since the majority of compilers are written in C generally but I wanted to create something to show my skills in C++ as a portfolio project. 
  
  W Lang is a weak typed procedual language when compiled creates bytelike code (psudo assembly) when then the bytecode gets interpreted. W Lang can be thought up like BASIC in terms on being a simple language. It doesn't have any frameworks or anything of that sort. If this language has a purpose besides writing it for fun it would be to help teach basic concepts of programming. I don't expect this language to get picked up of the sort.
